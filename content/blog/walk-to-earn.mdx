<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I want to get fit and stay healthy. That was my cliche New Year’s resolution. As part of the plan, I even got a gym membership, those fancy Nike sports shoes, and a few Decathlon t-shirts. However, I’ve still not been consistent with my workouts and haven’t achieved the desired results.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em><strong>You may ask why?</strong></em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I would say the combination of a lack of patience and incentive. I wanted to see an immediate impact and I was not being rewarded for the effort I was putting in. Hence, my intensity dropped, and started prioritizing other tasks over my workout.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">What if I tell you that you have a chance to earn a 20% Amazon discount voucher if you complete 10,000 steps in a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sounds motivating right? Well, I would go all in and an Amazon voucher certainly incentivizes me to get up from the bed and head out for a jog!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Childhood friends Misaal Turakhia, Abhay Pai, and Shivjeet Ghatge spotted an opportunity in this space and launched StepSetGo in January 2019. Three months into the launch of the app, it had seen 650,000 downloads with no marketing. That’s when the founders knew they had a winner and kept walking.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>What’s StepSetGo?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">StepSetGo is an application that helps people cross the exercise gap by motivating them to get out of their fitness rut and take steps towards improving their health with walking. It&#8217;s also a tool that lets users earn rewards for simply taking steps so that they can get access to new, free products or additional discounts on daily necessities over time.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Interesting right? Just download the app, keep the phone in your pocket and walk. Just walk, walk and walk in your office, home or wherever you are. Check the app at the end of the day and you have won a discount voucher!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The app has over 50L downloads and if you check the reviews on the app store, people are absolutely loving the experience of getting rewarded just for doing their daily routine tasks.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Now you would think this app is really cool. But wait, how are they earning?&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>StepSetGo primarily earns revenue from its advertisements</strong> – these are users who are able to watch a brief video in exchange for some virtual currency. It’s no secret, though, that StepSetGo is eyeing the bigger picture here. Without spending any money on advertising, the company already has customers flocking to download their app by word of mouth!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">And once they have a large customer base who are so spending so much time on the app, they can cross-sell them different things. Here’s how I think they can leverage their massive user base to increase their revenue &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>&nbsp;StepSetGo can launch its own merchandise or a fitness marketplace to sell various products that enhance a user’s fitness experience&nbsp;</li><li>Charge a fee from brands listing their offers on their platform and a commission whenever a sale happens through their platform</li><li>Start their own fitness subscription service&nbsp;</li><li>StepSetGo can be the perfect platform for big brands like Nike, Adidas to showcase and newly launched products and garner interest. This can be monetized too.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to Statista, the fitness industry in India is growing at a CAGR of 6.6 percent and is expected to reach $2,000 million by 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Growfitter- the gamified digital health platform which also featured on the first season of Shark Tank and got funding from BoAt’s Aman Gupta, works on a similar business model too.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As more and more people are becoming health-conscious, we can only see the demand for innovative new products in this industry growing!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Till then, just keep walking 🙂</p>
