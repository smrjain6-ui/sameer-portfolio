<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It’s the year 2022 and no one likes to read books. With the ever-increasing usage of social media and Youtube videos, our eyes are always glued to screens and our attention span has considerably reduced.<br><br>And I know you can’t blame yourself completely for it! During the lockdown, it was only our smartphones that kept us sane 😛</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Podcasts &amp; Audiobooks have immensely gained popularity in the last couple of years and the pandemic has fuelled the youth’s interest in Finance, startups, and educational content.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Why am I sharing this?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Because I want you to know about Kuku FM! The 2018-born company has just crossed 1m paid subscribers and is on the course to challenge the likes of Spotify.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>But what is Kuku FM?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>It’s basically an Indian platform for Audio Books and Podcasts</li><li>The app provides audio content across genres like self-help, motivational, educational, news, entertainment, spirituality, mythology, stories, and shows, among others</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>What’s special?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>It provides content in the Indian regional languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Bangla. This automatically increases their total addressable market.</li><li>It intends to redefine traditional radio by allowing users to discover new and diverse audio content in their preferred language.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>What can we learn from them?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Like Spotify, they have embraced the freemium model of user acquisition.</li><li>Users can come on the app and listen to any type of content but with ads and not have access to cool features like listening to content offline, premium add-free experience, personalized recommendations, etc.</li><li>Lastly, with the creator economy picking up, they’ve partnered with several influencers who are driving their registrations.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Many people thought Indians won’t pay for content. But Kuku has shown that a high-quality, value-adding product solving a customer need can create an outlier!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Now we have over 1 million Indian consumers paying for audio content in their local language! Revolutionary!&nbsp;</p>
