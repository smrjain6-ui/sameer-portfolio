<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ever since the IPL started, top businesses like Pepsi and Tata have been pouring thousands of crores into sponsorships to increase brand awareness and positive sentiments towards the brand.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While it’s okay to see these conglomerates invest such heavily, in 2020 it was astonishing to see that a 12-year-old startup like Dream 11 became the title sponsor of IPL for a whopping 222 crores. And since then there has been no looking back for the company as it has become one of the fastest growing sports fantasy platforms in the country with more than 140 million users as of 2021.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To give you more stats, it reported a 56.39% growth in total income at Rs 2,705.56 crore for the fiscal ended 31st March 2021, as against Rs 1,729.93 crore in the previous fiscal.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">So the big question is what is this business model? How are they able to earn so much money despite spending so heavily on marketing and working with big stars like MS Dhoni, Hardik Pandya, and Rishabh Pant?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Well, the revenue model is fairly simple. Dream11 is basically an organizer for various competitions categorized on the basis of amount and participants. For matching players, guaranteeing, and organizing these short competitions, it charges an entry fee, which is generally 20% of the total amount collected in particular competition and this is how it earns money.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For e.g. the entry fee for a particular competition is 50 Rs and the number of participants is 3,00,000. Out of these 3L people, the top scoring 150 people would be rewarded in a way that the top ranker gets the highest prize, and from thereon the amount keeps decreasing. So the total amount raised here would be 3,00,000 x 50Rs = 1.5 Cr and 20% would be Dream11’s cut. Hence, 30L would be Dream11’s revenue, and the rest of the money it distributes as prizes.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">So you see how lucrative is for Dream11, but if you think from a normal person’s perspective, if he/she invests a meagre 50 Rs and has the chance to win up to 1 Lakh Rs, there might be no double thinking there. That is why it has been able to lure so many people to its platform and use the cricket craze in India to its benefit.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One more thing that people don’t know about Dream11 is how it has been able to differentiate itself from being called a Gambling business.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It says that pure analytical skills, strategy, and historic knowledge about the players are required before building your team. Whereas in gambling, everything’s based on chance and luck. And this is absolutely true. A player’s form, stadium, the type of opposition can play such a huge role in predicting the performance of the player.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sounds great right? Everything seems hunky dory about this industry. Well, there’s more.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to a Ficci-EY report, the Indian fantasy sports industry is growing at a CAGR of 32% and is expected to be worth $3.7 billion by 2025.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This industry&#8217;s popularity is only going to grow in India. Fantasy gaming platforms have a bright future because games other than cricket are also getting user support, and there are great growth prospects. Even though Dream11 leads the fantasy gaming industry, rivals like MyTeam11 and Mobile Premier League have also come in and are building exciting products. This only means company and VCs clearly see a big opportunity and are ready to make money from 130 million people in India playing fantasy sports.</p>
