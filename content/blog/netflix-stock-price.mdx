<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Recently you might have heard about Netflix’s 70% stock price fall and how it had lost 200,000 subscribers in Q1 for the first time in a decade. A tech giant with the highest market share in the OTT industry and with a history of producing all-time great TV series, you might wonder if this is an excellent time to buy Netflix shares right?&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Well, let me tell you more about this industry and why I think Netflix might not be a good option to invest in at least in the next 12-14 months&#8230;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Since the pandemic began, demand for OTT platforms has clearly gone up and, almost every single major tech player in the world has entered this industry. Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, Youtube, all these platforms are fighting for customers and trying to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of the market.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Thus, investing in a company that is bound to lose customers seems a risky proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Secondly, a report mentioned that due to the war, Netflix had to shut its services in Russia and therefore they lost over 7,00,000 subscribers. Similar economic tensions and wars can pan out in the future which can have huge repercussions on the sales of the company. Also, with rising inflation and all the news around the recession, discretionary spending would come down and users would think twice before taking a subscription.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Thirdly and arguably the biggest reason why I think Netflix won’t succeed in this market is that it has a sole stream of revenue &#8211; memberships. Even if it wants to increase the number of shows it produces, it must undertake massive costs with no guaranteed performance or virality for any new series.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On the other hand, if you look at Disney, it has multiple revenue streams such as parks, experiences, and products being one segment, media and entertainment another, selling direct-to-consumer products, and many more. Thus, even if its OTT vertical doesn’t perform well, it has other streams to ensure a consistent revenue flow.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Well, Netflix has been aware of all these factors for some time now and there’s a reason why it is still the best (in terms of content) and everyone’s go-to platform.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The tech giant is planning to introduce new economical plans for the Indian market. They’re about to launch a system in which consumers won’t be able to share passwords. Lastly, they’re foraying into the ads business i.e. users who opt for low-cost plans would see ads on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It would be interesting to see the impact and reception of users to these changes. But as of now, I won’t be putting my money into Netflix stocks.</p>
