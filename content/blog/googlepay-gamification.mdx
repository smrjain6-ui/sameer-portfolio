<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Recently you might have heard the meme &#8211; paying from Google pay so quickly as if Google is paying for it</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This is funny. So funny that after Whatsapp, Google pay is my second most used app. And it’s not just me, my parents have started preferring Google pay payments over any cash transaction.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google Pay has established itself as one of the leading names in the digital payments industry due to its varied features and enabling you to go cashless. Google Pay has made it super simple to complete bank transfers, send and receive money, purchase online, and a number of other services.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>But did you ever think about how did Gpay acquire these users?</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Remember how GooglePay incentivized users to perform a specific task to get a reward of ₹251</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The task was to collect specific stamps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Each stamp required the user to scan a physical item or transfer money to other users.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">And these stamps were rare.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>What happened next?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">People in large numbers started requesting their friends, families, and coworkers to use Google Pay. Through a link, it enabled users to request stamps from friends. Even a leaderboard that displayed users&#8217; friends who still required stamps was introduced. Users could see the stamps their friends had and request them.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The content loop was such that it rewarded users even for collecting even 1 or 2 stamps, to keep them hooked.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gamification at its best.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">If we talk about the business model, that’s also something incredible.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Major competitors such as Phone Pe and Paytm charge about 1-2 Rs as transaction charges. But Gpay is absolutely free.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Despite being the second leading payment option in India, in June 2022, it was able to grow its net profit by 62% whereas the likes of Paytm and Phone Pe reported losses.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>But how does it make money?&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Commission on bills: Every time a user pays for a utility bill such as water, electricity, DTH, etc. it charges a commission from the company</li><li>Similarly, for every mobile recharge, it charges the telecom operator</li><li>Importantly, Gpay does not profit from all the UPI transactions that we make! Instead, it simply analyses our transaction data to create a new product. So an indirect way of earning!&nbsp;</li><li></li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gpay&#8217;s vision is simple and clear: they want to enable more activity on their platform and attract a large user base. It has built an intuitive platform that makes it easy for users to facilitate payments. It aims to become the household finance app of India!</p>
