<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There are 140 crore Indians</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Out of which approximately 14000 are HNIs and 7 crore retail investors</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, bond investing is only accessible to these HNIs&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Why?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Because investment in debt instruments through traditional channels needs huge capital commitments upfront.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>What’s the solution?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Wint Wealth!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>How is it solving?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>By democratizing assets (bonds) that were previously only available to the rich class and making them available to the retail investors</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>How big is the market??</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There are about 300-400 million people in India who invest in FDs or let their money stay in current accounts. And these are people who are not HNIs yet but have substantial money to park.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Reason?</strong> Simply lack of awareness about financial instruments&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Wint Wealth fits in right here by providing them with an asset class that is less risky than equities but higher-yielding than FDs.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>What’s so special about their product?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The minimum ticket size for investors is a mere 10,000 Rs.</li><li>Secondly, most of the bonds which are issued currently in the market repay the principal amount in one go. This instills fear amongst investors as it’s a binary event. But on Wint Wealth, the bonds are structured in a way that repayment happens over a period of time.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Now you, me, and every retail investor can invest in bonds and make steady returns.</p>
