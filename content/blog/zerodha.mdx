<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The stock broking industry that was once dominated by the likes of ICICI Direct, Sharekhan, and Indiabulls has undergone a transformation with the likes of Zerodha and Upstox coming in and disrupting the industry through newer technologies and adopting a consumer-first approach. Zerodha and Upstox combined own 1/3rd of the market share.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You might have seen ads of stock broker companies like Upstox and Groww promoting their products and services. But have you ever seen any ad of Zerodha?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">No, right? Despite being very similar businesses and having almost the same number of active accounts, Zerodha, a bootstrapped company for this year reported a profit of 1122 Cr whereas Upstox, which is backed by VC firms, reported a loss of 72 Cr.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sounds weird and interesting at the same time? Let’s try to examine what Zerodha did right.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Primarily it did 3 great things- identified its target audience, the pain points in the market, and a straightforward sustainable revenue model.<br><br>Target Audience-&nbsp; it only pitched its services to people who used to spend most of their time talking about the stock market i.e. traders.<br><br>And what were their pain points? High trading costs and slow transaction speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>How did it solve?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier traders were charged a percentage of their trade value as the brokerage fee.<strong> </strong>But under Zerodha’s model, they would be charged a meager Rs 20 per trade irrespective of the trade size and 0 Rs for equity investments.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Secondly, it introduced a fantastic user-friendly mobile and web app, which enabled a 2 click order system.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These 2 solutions appealed wonderfully well to the big ticket size traders and all of them switched to Zerodha. Also, to keep traders engaged with the platform and retain them, it came up with multiple initiatives!&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Zerodha&#8217;s 60-day trade challenge</li><li>Varsity- free stock market knowledge base,&nbsp;</li><li>integration with various investing apps such as Smallcase.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This created an ecosystem and one-stop solution for all your investing needs. It has also introduced excellent features such as enabling users to buy mutual funds through an integrated app, making applying for IPOs easier, an option to download transaction reports, and easy flowing intuitive UI that added so much value for the investors.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Now if we talk about why it has been able to remain profitable against other platforms, there are precisely two core reasons &#8211; Zero marketing cost and top-notch user experience. It relies on word of mouth and the Kamath brothers firmly believe that if you provide a good experience to your users, they would talk about your product in their social circles. And that’s what they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">By not investing in IPL ads or any social media campaigns, it was able to eliminate non-serious investors (who generally have no intention to start investing and increase the administrative costs for the broking firm) and save a ton lot of money.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Secondly, Zerodha does not provide any freebies to people for joining them. Other apps like Upstox gives every person who joins a stock worth 500 Rs for free along with a referral incentive of 1000 Rs. Add the compliance cost of roughly 300 Rs, and the acquisition cost comes to roughly 1800 Rs. And if you multiply this with the number of people opening their accounts, you can only imagine what the sum is!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The basic revenue model of brokerage business is attracting high-value frequent traders. And Zerodha has absolutely killed this model. Whereas other firms have totally gone the opposite route with the focus on low ticket size, and low-frequency traders.</p>
