<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yesterday I visited a shopping mall near my home and after roaming around for quite a bit, my parents and I ended up having our lunch there. As we headed to the food complex &#8211; where all restaurants are there, I noticed something unique that was a bit puzzling.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I saw 4 restaurants- McDonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Dominos.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mcd, Burger King and Pizza Hut’s restaurant seating capacity was significantly higher than that of Dominos.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Well, this instilled curiosity in me, and when I came back, I did my research on it.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To start off, let me throw some numbers there.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Domino&#8217;s operates <strong>1,495 stores across 322 Indian cities</strong> as on 31 December 2021. Therefore It&#8217;s easy to say that Domino&#8217;s is one of the market leaders in the fast food sector. So much so that when my mom doesn’t feel like cooking, Dominos is the go-to option for everyone in the house :p</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But how did Domino&#8217;s differentiate itself from its rivals?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>They introduced the much-needed Indian tinge on their pizzas. This helped them massively to please the Indian consumers and tap a big market. The toppings on the pizza are the everyday vegetables that we consume.</li><li>While other food joints focussed on dining in, Dominos took the other way round &#8211; ordering in and takeaways. It provided the convenience of ordering in and completely mastered it. The 30 min delivery model worked perfectly as it acted as a pull for consumers to order and no other pizza delivery service was able to match this delivery speed and customer service. </li><li>By doubling down on ordering in and takeaways, it was able to save a ton lot of costs on real estate and waiter salary.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the food business, it’s essential to have repeat customers. Dominos aced this by launching the campaign- 30 mins delivery otherwise free delivery.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The campaign became viral and consumers started to order for fun with the hope of getting the pizza for free. And once they ordered and they liked the taste, there’s no turning back. You have won yourself a repeat customer.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Dominos is the epitome of a cloud kitchen. It basically utilizes a commercial kitchen for the purpose of preparing food for delivery or takeout only, with no dine-in customers. It essentially became a virtual brand with no fixed cost apart from the kitchen. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With people getting busier and busier, internet penetration in the country improving, the delivery speed of items getting faster and the work-from-home economy picking up, I certainly think Cloud kitchen is the future.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Well, I’ve always been a fan of Dominos and after knowing about their business strategies, I’m impressed even more. Therefore, I’ll be treating myself with a Dominos pizza today 🙂 and so should you!</p>
