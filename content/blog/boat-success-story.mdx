<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In 2016, Aman Gupta and Sameer Mehta launched a fashionable consumer electronics company named BoAt. In the same year, two big changes happened in the world of digital accessories for electronic devices.<br><br>Firstly, a new affordable mobile service provider called Jio was launched in India and secondly, many phone manufacturers stopped shipping earphones with their phones as standard perks for customers instead opting to begin selling them separately instead. This led to widespread dissatisfaction among consumers who were used to receiving them for free and soon an increasing number of people were looking around for better quality alternatives that were less expensive than industry-standard offerings.<br><br>Many everyday users soon found themselves at a loss when they googled &#8216;online computer store&#8217; because most companies only sold the standard 3.5mm audio jacks which they already had too many of!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">BoAt’s product catalog featured products that were trendy, fashionable, comfortable, and most importantly affordable. From earphones starting at Rs 239 to Bluetooth speakers costing 4000 Rs, the brand was able to deliver the perfect fancy product at the perfect pricing.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Its target segment was simple &#8211; people who shop products between the premium and affordable categories.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Creating a number of products and then trying to sell them to as many people as you can is one thing, but how consumers perceive your company is another challenge entirely.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">BoAt has focused on gaining brand recognition among the youth through celebrities and popular culture. In India, cricket and Bollywood are two highly influential celebrity industries. Hoping to gain name recognition among young consumers, BoAt worked with these celebrities to initiate campaigns that made their headphones trend during IPL matches and music festivals such as Sunburn.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">They also have a catalog that is constantly growing! Knowing its target market &#8211; the young millennials &#8211; from the start, BoAt catered to its well-known wants.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Beginning with travel chargers/portable chargers, BoAt gradually expanded into other verticals, including earphones, headphones, cables, speakers, and now smartwatches.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>What can we learn?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There is no one-size-fits-all formula for success. Study your target audience, identify their needs, watch some trends, and then decide on the next step. BoAt’s projection as a lifestyle accessories brand was an ingenious move that broke all rules of the game. They wanted their products to become a part of everyday fashion.</p>
