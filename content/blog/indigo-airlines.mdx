<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the past 2 months, I have taken 4 flights. Two were Spicejet (my favorite till now), one Air India, and one Indigo. On all the flights except Indigo, I landed or took off 20-30 mins late&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">whereas my parents had taken 2 flights in the past 10 days, both Indigo arrived well on time.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When it happened to me, I just thought it was a one-off thing but when I saw how happy my parents were with their journey, I decided to give this more thought and research.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong><em>To get you started, let me share a few stats</em></strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Indigo has a 55% market share and it carried over 75 million passengers in 2020 despite the pandemic! It also made a profit of around 16.3 billion Indian rupees in the financial year 2020 while most of the major domestic private airlines suffered losses.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You might wonder what has been their secret sauce right? How have they been so profitable in a capital-intensive industry?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Well, it’s no rocket science. IndiGo&#8217;s success model largely relies on consistent low fares, regular on-time performance, and minimal flight cancellations. The three most basic values that we as domestic passengers expect</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>So much so that, the name “Indigo” has become synchronous with punctuality. And if you would have observed, Indigo aircraft are simple and neat. No fancy screens or meals, just basic comfortable seats with enough leg room. Hence the low fares.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Secondly, by selling and leasing back its jets, Indigo keeps its fleet small. It uses six-year sale and leaseback agreements to replace its aircraft regularly and can accommodate flights as per the market conditions. Also since this model doesn’t require any big upfront payments, the company is able to stay cash-flow rich and increase its profits. Lastly, the airline company employs the least number of workers in the industry.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In spite of all the cost-cutting genius strategies, I feel the airline&#8217;s biggest edge over others is its customer-first service. Just by ensuring that the customer reaches his/her destination on time, IndiGo won its common man with this very basic model.</p>
