<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>1. How do you define money? </strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Means to buy more stuff (commodity)&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Freedom to do whatever you want</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>2. Getting Rich vs Building wealth? </strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Rich vs Wealth: difference&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Money is more important in Psychology than your money-making skills. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>3. Wonders of compounding </strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett’s $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Invest for the long term and let compounding do its job</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>4. Each of us has our own investment philosophy and none of us are wrong. </strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Eg. Parents FD</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Why? we have grown up in different times </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>5. Volatility is the price you pay by staying in the market: </strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Market will always be volatile. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>6. You are in for a surprise with your investments: </strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Every thought about why does the stock market crash ~10 YEARS?&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; 90s Dot Com Crash, 2000s Financial Market Crash, 2020, Corona crash&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Reason is different every year. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">7. <strong>Diversification is the key: </strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Eg. Invest in Debt vs Equity&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>8. Save every penny you can</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Understand the definition of investments vs expenditures&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8211; Identify what you need vs what you want </p>
