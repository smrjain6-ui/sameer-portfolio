<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Straightforward, clear writing is the most effective at communicating the true meaning. Thus, minimize the usage of unnecessary words and phrases.</li><li>While writing you should always ask yourself- what are you trying to say? What’s the objective? Look at what you’ve written and ask- have you written that? Is it clear to the person who doesn’t know anything about the topic?</li><li>Spend time perfecting your beginnings and ends because they have a huge impact on reader engagement.</li><li>The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn’t induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead. And if the second sentence doesn’t induce him to continue to the third sentence, it’s equally dead.</li><li>Therefore, the reader must be immediately captivated by your idea to keep reading. It must entice him/her with novelty, freshness, humor, surprise, paradox, unexpected ideas, intriguing facts, or a provocative question.</li><li>Write about what you enjoy and enjoy what you write about and others will love reading your work.</li></ul>
