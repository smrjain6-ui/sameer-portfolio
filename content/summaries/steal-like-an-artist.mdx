<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Write or build something. If you’re out of ideas, identify the three best people in your niche and research their work. Repurpose that and you would have something to work upon.</li><li><strong>The most powerful line of the book is</strong> &#8211; “Creativity is about mixing what is already present and creating something out of it.”</li><li>Keep collecting good ideas. The better ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.</li><li>Always work on a side project(s). It gives you the freedom to explore and work on something you truly love. It’s the side projects that really take off.</li><li>The work you’re doing while procrastinating, that should be your full-time work.</li><li>If you feel burnt out, wash the dishes. Take a long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall for as long as you can. Fantastic ideas come out of boredom.</li><li>Choose your friends and people whom you hang out with wisely. If you ever find that you’re the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room.</li><li>Find people on the Internet who love the same things as you and connect with them.</li><li>Appreciate people on the internet. Post your quick summary, takeaways, or anything. Eventually, these people will find you and help you in the long run. Sharing your thoughts is important.</li><li>Expose your brain to new and uncomfortable surroundings. That is when it works the most and you learn the most.</li></ul>
