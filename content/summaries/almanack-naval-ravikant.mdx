<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Figure out what society wants and build innovative products. Use your specific knowledge and scale the product or service you’re building</li><li>Wealth creation is a skill that can be learned by anyone. To create wealth, you must give society value; you must give something that society needs but they don’t know yet</li><li>Wealth works on itself while you’re sleeping. It could be the program you wrote that’s working for you while you’re on vacation, a business you’ve to step up, or merely a content piece</li><li>Go on the internet and pick out a niche for yourself. Build your personal brand. Learn to code, write, or just generally add value. It would pay off in the long run.</li><li>You can never get wealthy by just doing the job or renting out your time. Time is a limited commodity; it becomes harder to build wealth because you can’t work 24&#215;7.</li><li>Things like holding equity in a business that makes money while you’re sleeping, making money by investing it in stocks, funds, and bonds, or creating content and media, would make you wealthy</li><li>Keep working hard and let compounding play its game. All the great things in life result from compounding: your relationship, building start-ups, or even friendships.</li><li>Time is the most valuable thing we have. Be conscious of what your time is being spent on.</li><li>Spend time with people who share similar values and with whom you can work for a long time</li><li>Once you recognize what’s that thing you truly love, it won’t work anymore. Classic e.g., Elon Musk. His love for tech resulted in Tesla, SpaceX</li><li>Happiness is subjective. When you think you have everything in life or nothing is missing, true happiness is that state.</li><li>You come alone in this world and die alone. Live life based on your virtues and dreams.</li></ul>
